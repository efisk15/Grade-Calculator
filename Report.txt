Four hours tracked towards the final lab (2 pts each)

Pros and cons of using classes (OOP) for this specific idea/problem 
using classes enables us to sperate differnet methodsof calculating the gpas, for both semester and cumulative. also allows us to more clearly
orgnaize .h files and keep each part of the code more visibly appealing. 




Describe at least one data structure we have covered that would be useful 
and explain why.
i used a map for the callulating how much the overall is affected, based on what letter grade is achieved the certiain amount of credits will be allocated and 
based on that divided on the total amount of credit take wil the final gpa be calculated. Using a map is advantageous because itâ€™s easy to traverse and update 
compared to a vector, making my calculations more straightforward and efficient. which would streamline the calculation process. 

provides at a high level least two test cases/unit
      tests for the problem outlined above (2 pts each)

2 test cases: 

Test Case 1: Fully Graduated Student
Scenario: A fully graduated student with one major and one minor.
Input: The student has varying grades across multiple courses with different credit levels.
Expected Output: The GPA should be calculated accurately based on the grades and credit hours, reflecting the student's performance in both the major and minor.

Test Case 2: Sophomore Student with Multiple Minors
Scenario: A sophomore student pursuing one major and two minors.
Input: The student has similar grades across courses with varying credit levels and different grading weight methods.
Weighting methods could include:
Test-heavy assessments
Assignment-heavy evaluations
Participation-heavy contributions
